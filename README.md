This tool is supposed to fix IDA 7.5 files saved with inconsistent function folder tree. In IDA this leads to empty Functions view when you tick Show folders, but otherwise no error is given.

✅ a0 - read folders

✅ a1 - modify folder name

❌ a2 - modify folder parent/subs

❌ a3 - add folder

Based on https://github.com/nlitsme/pyidbutil but with write capability.
